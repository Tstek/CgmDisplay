# CgmDisplay
Personal tool by Stewart Post to view CGM data from nightscout in a small window

This was built for my personal use as a tool to view my blood sugar in VR through applications like XSOverlay, or on the desktop.

By clicking the time you can trigger the title bar appearing/disappearing for a cleaner look:
